# Multi_Lick_ports_behavioral_setup
Multi_Lick_ports_behavioral_setup is designed for multiple liquid delivering and facial activity recording to mice. It is consisted with two parts: head fix setup and lick ports setup. With tiny and simple head bar and head fix design, it exposes facial parts as much as possible, allowing sufficient facial recording. Multichannel delivering port also allows feeding mice with different liquid simultaneously.
